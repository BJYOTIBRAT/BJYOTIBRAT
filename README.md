- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know? The first computer "bug" was a real bug! In 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II found a moth trapped in a relay, causing an error in the machine. They documented the incident in their logbook as the "first actual case of a bug being found." And thus, the term "debugging" was born!
